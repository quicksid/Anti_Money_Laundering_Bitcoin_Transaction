# Anti_Money_Laundering_Bitcoin_Transaction
This repository is created for development of Anti Money Laundering project to analyze and identify patterns in the cryptocurrency transactions in the Blockchain world.

## Dataset
The Elliptic Data Set maps Bitcoin transactions to real entities belonging to licit categories (exchanges, wallet providers, miners, licit services, etc.) versus illicit ones (scams, malware, terrorist organizations, ransomware, Ponzi schemes, etc.). The task on the dataset is to classify the illicit and licit nodes in the graph.
The work behind this dataset was funded by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab (mitibm.mit.edu), a joint research initiative between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and IBM Research. Data and domain expertise were provided by Elliptic (www.elliptic.co).
